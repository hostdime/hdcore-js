![image](https://travis-ci.org/hostdime/hdcore-js.png)

A simple wrapper around [HostDime.com](http://www.hostdime.com/)'s client API.

## Install

    npm install hdcore

## Usage

~~~js
var hdcore = require('hdcore');
var client = hdcore.createClient('public_key', 'private_key');
~~~

~~~js
client.call('server.list', function(err, servers){
  if (err)
    return console.error(err);
  
  servers.forEach(function(server) {
    console.log(server.name);
  });
});
~~~

### hdcore.createClient(public_key, private_key, options)

Creates the API object. `options` is an optional object with the following acceptable properties:

* `endpoint` - The URL to the API endpoint. This defaults to `https://api.hostdime.com/v1`
* `sandbox` - Toggles a sandbox mode that prevents any changes to your account, which is useful for testing and development purposes. This defaults to `false`


### client.call(api_method[, opts], callback)

Calls the API method, with an optional `options` object. `callback` is a function which is invoked with the following two arguments:

* `err` - An error object, if an error occurred, otherwise `null`.
* `result` - The result object, if successful, otherwise `null`.
